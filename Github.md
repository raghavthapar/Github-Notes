# GITHUB

## What is Github?

- Hosting platform for git repos.
- We can put them on Cloud which allows us to share them, access them anywhere we want and collaborate with people.
- Just an online place alongside Gitlab, BitBucket and Gerrit.

## Why to use it?

- Collaboration is the biggest reason as we can share our work with anyone in the world.
- Open Source Projects(where codebase is available to make contribuitions) E.g. React
- Gives exposure and showcases your work that you have been doing.
- Looks really good on your resume
- Helps to stay up to date, technology wise.

## Cloning

- Using this, we can get a copy of any public repo on the local machine.
- This is when the repository is already existing on Github.
- Cloning initializes a new repo automatically on our machine.
- Cloning a repo gives us the access to the whole history of the repo.
- Make sure that you are not inside a repo when you clone a repo.

Command -

### `git clone <git-repo-url>`

- Anyone can clone any repo on Github (Private ones do not show up at all).
- git clone is not bound to Github and we can clone any repo that is hosted anywhere.

## Creating Repos on Github

- If an existing repo exists then ->

  1. Create a new repo on Github
  2. Connect your local repo (add a remote)
  3. Push your changes to Github

- If no repo exists ->

  1. Create a brand new repo on Github
  2. Clone the repo to our machine
  3. Do work locally and push changes to Github
