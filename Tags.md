# GIT TAGS

- Git tags are labels that refer to specific commits in the history
- These are usually used to label/mark somekind of version of the project
- Can also be said as branch references that do not change
- Two types of tags -

  1. **Lightweight** - These are simply a label to a new commit

  2. **Annotated** - These have a small message kinda like commit messages and also contain the author name, email etc. Just stores some metadata about the tag
