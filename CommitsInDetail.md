# COMMITS IN DETAIL

## Atomic Commits

- Each commit should have only one feature, change or fix.
- Keep each commit fixed on a single thing

Why?
It makes easier to see what changes you have done so far and then if needed, the rollback is also easy.

## How to write commit messages?

- Always keep the messages in present tense.
- The final say comes in your preference.
- Present tense is the prime choice tho.
