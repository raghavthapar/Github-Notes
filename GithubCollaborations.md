# GITHUB COLLABORATION AND WORKFLOWS

## Centralized Workflows

- The most simple and basic of workflow
- Everyone works on the master branch (or a single branch)
- Good for tiny teams

- The shortcomings of this method are -
  1. Lot of time is spent in merging and solving conflict
  2. Main codebase is always at risk and no experiments can be done with the project
  3. Collaboration can only be possible if others get the incomplete code of one collaborator.
