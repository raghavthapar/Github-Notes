<================================== BRANCHING ==================================>

## What is branching?

- Branching is required where we need to work on different contexts. For e.g. if we need to implement an experimental feature, or we need to do something that will break the code in some way etc.
- Branches are kind of alternative timelines for the project
- If we make changes on one branch, then it doesn't affect any other branch.
- We can merge branches as well which will result in both the branches being put together.
- Branches exists in isolation

## What is a master branch?

- We are always on a branch and the default is the master branch
- Master branch is just like any other branch
- Master branch is something that many of us use that can be the main branch where nothing should go wrong etc.
- Github renamed the master branch to 'main'
- We can also change the name of the branches according to our own choice, even the master/main one.

## What is Head->master in git log?

- HEAD is simply a pointer that refers to the current location in our repo
- HEAD in simple words is the current branch/location that we are checking out/viewing/working on
- HEAD is a pointer and a reference to the branch pointer. (The branch pointer is where a branch currently is)
