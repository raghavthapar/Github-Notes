<================================== BRANCHING ==================================>

## What is branching?

- Branching is required where we need to work on different contexts. For e.g. if we need to implement an experimental feature, or we need to do something that will break the code in some way etc.
- Branches are kind of alternative timelines for the project
- If we make changes on one branch, then it doesn't affect any other branch.
- We can merge branches as well which will result in both the branches being put together.
- Branches exists in isolation
